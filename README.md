# Avalanche
Implementations of contagion models in financial networks.

# Development
We develop in Jupyter notebooks using the [BeakerX enhancements](http://beakerx.com/documentation).

# Commands
source activate beakerx
source deactivate beakerx

# Scripts
There are two scripts to generate either the size-to-frequency results of the avalanche model or a timeline of defaults. These scripts are size_to_frequency.py and timeline.py, respectively, and can be run on the command-line with 'python <script_name>'.
